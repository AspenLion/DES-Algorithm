https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/publications/fips/46/3/archive/1999-10-25/documents/fips46-3.pdf

Requires that the message and key be in text files.
For encrypting, the message should be in ASCII.
For decrypting, the message should be in hexidecimal.
The key needs to be a 64-bit hexidecimal.
Output will be given in both ASCII and hexidecimal.
